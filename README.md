# GTA Belgium's San Fierro and Las Venturas Remastered Map Add-On  (FiveM-ready)
GTA Belgium's San Fierro and Las Venturas Remastered addon , which I compressed the textures and put into a FiveM resource (not optimized for FiveM by any means). 
Also includes limits resource to fix cars breaking down outside the "world limits".

Released on cfx.re forums at this link https://forum.cfx.re/t/gta-belgiums-san-fierro-and-las-venturas-remastered-map-add-on-fivem-ready/1340064

*NOTE: **this is a quite resource intensive addon map for a FiveM server as it was not designed with the intention to be streamed to FiveM to begin with***
----

**With that said let's continue to the good stuff**
# Installation:
1. **To add this to your server, put the `[SFLV-GTABelgium_FiveM-Ready]` folder in your resources folder and then add the following lines to your `server.cfg`**
```
start limits
start sflv_by-gtabelgium
```
2. **After that start your server up and you should be good to go!!!**

Once again all credits go to [GTA Belgium on GTA-5Mods.com](https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/las-venturas-san-fierro-dlc-remastered), 
I simply adapted the mod and compressed the textures so it would work in FiveM
