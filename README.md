# GTA Belgium's San Fierro and Las Venturas Remastered Map Add-On  (FiveM-ready)
GTA Belgium's San Fierro and Las Venturas Remastered addon , which I compressed the textures and put into a FiveM resource (not optimized for FiveM by any means). 
Also includes limits resource to fix cars breaking down outside the "world limits".

**POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT!!**

According to [ReadyP1ayerTwo](https://github.com/ReadyP1ayerTwo) turning down "extended distance scaling" (I assume in the pause menu settings?) makes a big difference in performance, so you should try this to see if it may help you in that aspect (I can't test it for myself, but I am hoping to get a screenshot of where to find that option in the paused menu settings.

Exact location of "Extended Distance Scaling" in Pause Settings

**POTENTIAL ISSUES**

(Just like above I am unable to test this so someone else will have to confirm it)
Reported by [ReadyP1ayerTwo](https://github.com/ReadyP1ayerTwo), there could be some invisible objects with collisions at (X:6990.9735,Y:10056.08889,Z:10.1683)

~~Released on cfx.re forums at this link~~ 
(Moderators closed the topic...)

*NOTE: **this is a quite resource intensive addon map for a FiveM server as it was not designed with the intention to be streamed to FiveM to begin with***
----

**With that said let's continue to the good stuff**
# Installation:
1. **To add this to your server, put the `[SFLV-GTABelgium_FiveM-Ready]` folder in your resources folder and then add the following lines to your `server.cfg`**
```
start limits
start sflv_by-gtabelgium
```
2. **After that start your server up and you should be good to go!!!**

Once again all credits go to [GTA Belgium on GTA-5Mods.com](https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/las-venturas-san-fierro-dlc-remastered), 
I simply adapted the mod and compressed the textures so it would work in FiveM
